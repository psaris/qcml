Q Implementation of Coursera's Machine Learning Course

Using many of the tools
and a few of the machine learning algorithms implemented in [funq](https://github.com/psaris/funq), 
each example file ex[1-8].q demonstrates the solutions to [Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

Some functionality is not available in q, and the code, therefore, 
offloads the heavy lifting to Andre Zholos' [qml](https://github.com/zholos/qml) project
and [libsvm](https://github.com/cjlin1/libsvm).

To start, clone this project, install qml, and type `make install` to download and install libsvm.
